# The Goal of the Project

The goal of the Project to develop a small application, where tweets cards would be rendered. It
should be also possible to click on each card and the button will be changed to "following -
button". This provide an opportunity to repeat HTML and CSS basics, to work with APi and to learn
how create small one. We have had also a chance to repeat Hooks, React components, Axios,
asyncOperations.

# Difficulties

I have had the Problems with a rendering Components, in Component "user" occurs a fetch on backend
by first render, that we not need. Despite all my tries I didn't fixed that. I also didn't do the
additional tasks, because of time. Its very sad.
